# Python-Project-Inventory

- I wrote an application that will read a spreadsheet file from my local system.
- It will read some information from spreadsheet file and do something with that data.
- And this could be very useful if I am working with lots of files 
  and I want to do some data processing in those data file 
  and I don't want to do that manually by automating 
  or writing a program in Python that basically can do anything in a file or across multiple files.
